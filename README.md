*Luke Konstantopoulos*
## Overview and Origin
---

## Name of company
IOHK, (Internet Online Hong Kong) specificially their work on _Cardano_

## When was the company incorporated?
2015
## Who are the founders of the company?
Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. 


## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?


It wasn't until 2015 when Charles and Jermey got together and wanted to create the 3rd generation of blockchain technology. 1st being bitcoin, 2nd being ETH and 3rd being IOHKKs Cardano.IOHKs mission is located on their [website](https://iohk.io/en/about/) and states:
"We view the world as a series of giant and mostly interconnected social graphs with hundreds of complex systems embedded. Our mission is to perturb the graphs to a more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value" 


Essentially, IOHK and Charles Hoskinson's vision is to make a platform built for a sustainable future, to help people work better together, trust one another, and build global solutions to global problems.

## How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
IOHK is a private company that was initially funded by Charles and Jeremy themselves until they accepted venture capital. They later on started Cardanos ICO which has been raising money ever since. Cardanos ADA raised 63 million in early 2017. IOHKs position in cardano is more than 1 billion dollars. 
# Business Activities:

## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
IOHK and cardano aren't specifically trying to solve an individual financial problems as much as they are trying to make he world more connected. This does involve a financial aspect however. IOHK is trying to make things such as insurance, lending and investing more accessible for the less fortunate. 

## Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
IOHKs technology is trying to fundamentally change the world we live in, but it starts with the less fortunate. Cardano is currently working with the Ethiopian government to accelerate their progression out of poverty by giving them the technology as well as teaching them how to use it.   
The intended customer in broad terms, is the less fortunate. Specifically right now Cardano is working with Ethiopia and their government to achieve their goal of a blockchain backed by a governance
Governance plays a big factor in mainstream adoption according to Hoskinson in multiple interviews.

## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Cardano offers opportunity. The main question Co-founder Hoskinson asks himself is "How can we use this technology (Blockchain) to resolve the problems of the developing world?" They have done this by taking it upon themselves to teach their technology to inpovished communities. They have already actioned this forming an agreement with the Ethiopian government and taking on 5 million Ethiopian students, these students will learn how to use Cardanos blockchain technology and then subsequently tech others how to do so as well. This will create a domino effect and slowly change the Ethiopian narrative, generation by generation. Something that is unapparelled by any of IOHKs competitors.

They have an unfair advantage of having Hoskinson see what was wrong with his previous project (Ethereum) and has been given the opportunity to make Cardano everything that Ethereum is not. This is however a disadvantage because Etherum was there first and is backed and recognised by more retail and industry investors. Evident by [cardanos market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) (14/05/21 @12:25hrs) compared to Ethereum, the 24hr trading volume for [Ethereums](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) is higher than 5 times more than Cardanos.

Scalability, interoperability and sustainability. It is Cardanos goal to fix these issues that have plagued the likes of bitcoin and Ethereum.. 

Cardano is still yet to transcend into their most important stages like the implementation of smart contracts, they are currently in the second stage of their 5-part roadmap. (Shelly) In comparison to Ethereum and Bitcoin which are already well established. That being said, IOHK and Cardano don't hold much authority to the likes of their competitors.   The biggest advantage that cardano has over its competitors is its newly formed partnerships with developing governance.  
  
## Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
IOHK incorporates blockchain technology to achieve their goal of making the world more connected and erasing the lines of the developed community, and the developing community. IOHK aren't necessarily implementing their technology just yet, it is still quite early. Cardano is still quite a means away from reaching what it is they set out to achieve. However, this is some of the technologies that cardano is planning on utilizing to reach those goals.

Cardano uses a proof of stake protocol which is an upgrade over the proof of work. Proof of stake randomly selects a node to validate the next block, however it is not completely random. There is a linear correlation between the amount of ADA you stake and the likelihood of the validator being chosen to make the next block. Cardano utilize this system as it:
1. Creates less centralization, it is easier to team up with other miners in proof of work in which they can control the exchanges. _(The 51% attack)_
2. Creates stake for the validators. Your staked ADA will be lost if you conduct any illicit activities.
3. Uses a great deal less of electricity.

Cardano also plan on using a 'treasury wallet'. How this works is that a small fee is applied and stashed away in the treasury wallet every time A transaction has been made. This funding is used for future upgrades. All requests are made through a ballet system in which is accepted or declined by the board of treasury. A ballet states how much funding the individual needs and what they intend to do with it. The treasury receives benefits by voting. 

Cardano will also use smart contracts. The next phase for the cardano team is launching smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are contracted requirements made during transactions. It is not until these contracted requirements are filled that the currency will be sent to the receiver.

# Landscape:

## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Blockchain
## What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The blockchain industry has only been around for approximately 12 years, in this time it was mostly just considered a 'scam' or 'Not valuable'. Blockchain is slowly being adopted by retail and institutional investors. Most people know about bitcoin and its dominance by now. 

One of the most recent trends may be NFTs. (Non-Fungible Tokens) They are what the name suggest, these tokens live within the blockchain. NFTs can be anything from paintings sold by your favourite artist, to a highlight dunk from your favourite NBA player. The argument for this is that they are just digital, you can just search up a photo of that same painting without having to pay for it. However, it goes deeper than this. NFTs can be a way to support creators, they can be a way to own something that only a finite amount of people own, they can be assets to your virtual portfolio.  


## What are the other major companies in this domain?
The likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum are the founding fathers of this domain.
# Results

## What has been the business impact of this company so far?
This company has shown people or plans to show people how blockchain technology can change the physical world we live in. They have done this by not becoming a meme and taking what they do very seriously, Hoskinson has come out and during many occasions has said that he does not care about making people rich. Hoskinson's goal is to change the world, and with the recent agreement with Ethiopia, people are starting to see that. IOHK and Cardano are brining positive media to a space that needs it.

## What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
One of the course metrics used in the cryptocurrency space is 24-hour trading volume. The 24-hour volume of a cryptocurrency coin is how much value of a coin have been bought and sold within the 24-hour period.

Cardano is preforming very well, considering the fact that they are only on the 3rd part of a 5-part roadmap. Also considering Cardano do not have a products or services avaialbe yet. (17/05/2021)

## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Cardanos 24-hour [trading volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/) is $12,239,047,944 at 12:18am 16/05/2021.  One of Cardanos biggest competitors which is at a similar stage in development is [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/), which is at 
$7,778,000,984. This is quite a dramatic difference, however it is a different story when you compare Cardanos market volume to the giant that is Ethereum. Since they both have smart contract functionality, they will be compared. But Cardano is in the early stages of development.

# Recommendations

## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would personally advise IOHK to partner with influences, artists and content creators that stand for the same qualities as IOHK does. They can use Cardanos platform to mint and sell NFTs, the funds that are gained from these NFT auctions can be donated to a charity of the creators choice. 

## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I believe this shows people that there is good that can come through blockchain technology, it is not just a means of making money. Besides the fact that it would breed positive feedback from the community, it will help the rate of adoption of blockchain users.

## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The technologies needed to apply the use of NFTs is something that Cardano is already working on. Cardano already has the blockchain technology, they just need complete and release it to the community. However, it is more difficult than it sounds. Cardano needs to make this technology easily accessible and easy to use, while also ensuring the safety of the people and their assets. 

## Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
It is the only way to mint NFTs on the Cardano blockchain. On the other hand, people can make NFTs via different blockchains and send them to the Cardano blockchain. However that is still a long ways to go, but it is something Cardano is trying to achieve. Cross-chain interoperability.
